So far, I have made a few cool projects - both from college and high school. Feel free to check them out!

Here was my attempt at a choose-your-own-adventure game using the DOM. GitHub Link Here https://github.com/andrewM202/dom-adventure-game

This was a partner project (with Iraidalis Lugo), where we made a working tic-tac-toe game. GitHub Link Here https://github.com/andrewM202/tic-tac-toe

Down here are a couple of my high school projects

This was my final project in high school in my website design classes

For this project, we made a website to represent a company for a random partner in our class. Mine ended up being for a nature-based company - here is the home page.
